This project involves combining and transforming datasets from three separate CSV files — 2018.csv, 2019.csv, and later 2020.csv — into a single, consolidated Excel file named Final_Output.xlsx.
The process includes:
•	Importing data from multiple yearly CSV files.
•	Merging them into a unified dataset for analysis.
•	Cleaning and transforming the data (e.g., handling missing values, formatting columns, and standardizing data types).
•	Exporting the final, processed dataset to Final_Output.xlsx for reporting and visualization purposes.
